# noop skeleton project

## What is it?

It's a minimal example project using the
[noop game framework](https://github.com/hbraun/noop). If you want to get
started with the framework, just clone this repository and start adding your own
code.

Like noop itself, this skeleton project is written in CoffeeScript. If you want
to use JavaScript instead, it shouldn't be too hard to adapt the project.


## How do I get started?

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
3. Install [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) using npm.
4. Execute ./develop
5. Open index.html and index-test.html in a browser.
6. Write code!


## Where can I learn more about noop?

Right now there's barely any documentation. Until any shows up at the
[noop repository](https://github.com/hbraun/noop) the code itself is your best
source of information.
